In AWS:
•	Developers create EC2, EBS, ELB, RDS, etc.
•	They forget to delete them
•	AWS keeps charging 
Automatically delete only those resources that we explicitly allow to be deleted, so costs stay low and production stays safe.
EventBridge (Schedule)->Lambda Function->AWS APIs 


1.EventBridge – WHY we need it
What is EventBridge?
AWS’s scheduler.
Why use EventBridge?
Because:
•	Lambda does NOT run by itself
•	We need something to trigger it automatically
•	EventBridge is:
o	Serverless
o	Cheap
o	Reliable
What it does here
“Run cleanup every day at  some time ”
Every night → wake up Lambda → do cleanup → sleep again
2. Lambda Function – WHY we use it
What is Lambda?
•	Serverless function
•	Runs code only when needed
•	No EC2, no servers, no maintenance
Lambda’s role here
Lambda is the decision-maker:
•	List resources
•	Check tags
•	Decide delete or skip
•	Call AWS delete APIs
3.  IAM Role – WHY it is mandatory
Important rule in AWS
Lambda cannot do ANYTHING unless IAM allows it
Why IAM Role?
•	Lambda needs permission to:
o	List EC2
o	Delete EC2
o	Delete EBS, ELB, etc.
Lambda starts
→ AWS gives it temporary role credentials
→ Lambda calls AWS APIs securely
4. Tags – WHY they are the SAFETY SWITCH
What is a tag?
A key–value metadata:

Key   = AutoDelete
Value = true
6. Terraform – WHY we use it
Why NOT click in AWS Console?
•	Manual
•	Error-prone
•	Not repeatable
Terraform Benefits
✔ Infrastructure as Code
✔ Version control
✔ Easy rollback
✔ Same setup in all accounts
